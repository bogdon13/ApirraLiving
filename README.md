# Apirra Living



This website was designed and built for **Apirra Living**. They are a development 
and import/export company based out of British Columbia, Canada. The site was first 
built off sketches and wireframes until preliminary mockups were produced. They have 
undergone many itterations and changes as the client adjusts their requirements and 
will continue to do so until completed. 

Original design mockups were done in InVision Studio (no longer available) and can be found 
in the designs folder as jpgs. These mockups as well as the rest of the pages are under
development in a new interface design tool and will be uploaded soon.
